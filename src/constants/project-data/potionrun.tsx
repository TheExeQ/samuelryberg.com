    <p>
      Potion Run was the first game project that i developed during my time at
      The Game Assembly, it is a runner game in which a gnome character is
      tasked with delivering a potion to a village before it becomes corrupted
      by an evil monster. <br />
      <br />
      The game involves avoiding obstacles along the way in order to preserve as
      much of the potion as possible before arriving at the destination. As a
      runner game, the focus is on keeping the gnome character moving forward
      while navigating the obstacles that appear in his path.
