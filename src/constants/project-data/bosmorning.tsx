      My fifth project at The Game Assembly was an adventure top-down game
      called "Bo's Morning." The game revolved around a farmer named Bo, who had
      to save his farm from a plague that had caused all animals and plants in
      the area to become evil.
      <br />
      <br />
      In order to save his farm, Bo had to eliminate the infectious flower that
      was causing the plague. The game design involved a lot of creativity, as
      we had to think about how to create an immersive world for the player to
      explore
