      My eighth project at The Game Assembly was another game built on the same
      engine &quot;Volt&quot; we created in our sixth project. Since we already
      had most of the functionality required to create games, we were able to
      get started a lot faster this time around.
      <br />
      <br />
      With a solid engine to work with and 8 weeks of full-time work ahead of
      us, we were prepared for much more this time around. The game we created
      was a first-person shooter game called &quot;Vipertrace&quot; which was
      inspired by Call of Duty: Black Ops - Zombies.

      In this futuristic sci-fi adventure, players step into the boots of a
      resilient protagonist in the bustling metropolis of Tokyo. As the city
      grapples with an invasion of velociraptor aliens, gamers must harness an
      impressive arsenal of high-tech weaponry to combat the extraterrestrial
      threat and ascend to newfound power. Navigate the neon-lit streets, engage
      in intense battles, and strategically advance through the alien-infested
      terrain.
