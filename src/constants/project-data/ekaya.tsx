    <p>
      My seventh project at The Game Assembly was another game built on the same
      engine &quot;Volt&quot; we created in our previous project. Since we
      already had most of the functionality required to create games, we were
      able to get started a lot faster this time around.
      <br />
      <br />
      We also had the advantage of being able to improve on our previous
      mistakes, which made the development process much smoother. The game we
      created this time was a third-person adventure game called &quot;Ekaya &
      Pebbles: A Helping Hand&quot;.
      <br />
      <br />
      In this game, players take on the role of a female character named Ekaya,
      who sets out on a journey to restart the heart of an ancient colossus.
      Along the way, she is accompanied by a little companion named Pebbles, who
      has telekinetic powers that can help her on her journey.
