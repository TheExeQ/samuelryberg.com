    <p>
      My fourth project at The Game Assembly was a 2.5D platformer that was
      unlike anything I had worked on before. The game was called &quot;Bard
      Knight&quot; and it was about a knight who had to collect musical
      instruments and traverse through levels to complete his songs. <br />
      <br />
      What made this project unique was that we got the chance to collaborate
      with students from a music school called Ã–stra Grevie. This collaboration
      allowed us to incorporate music into the gameplay in a way that was both
      fun and educational.
